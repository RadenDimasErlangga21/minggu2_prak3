    <h3><center>Laravel is a free, open-source PHP web framework, created by Taylor Otwell and intended 
        for the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural 
        pattern and based on Symfony. Some of the features of Laravel are a modular packaging system with 
        a dedicated dependency manager, different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that 
        aid in application deployment and maintenance, and its orientation toward syntactic sugar.</center></h3>
